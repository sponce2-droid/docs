Cost-pooling made easy! Hopkins may be expensive, but life doesn't have to be.

College students love saving money and Hopkins students are no exception.  One of the problems that Hopkins students face is paying an egregious amount of money for ride sharing apps due to the difficulties of finding people to share a ride with.  JHU students already try to post on GroupMe to find other students to split costs, but this solution is difficult to manage and reaches only a small portion of the overall JHU population.

Our platform allows Hopkins students who use ride-sharing apps to easily find people to split the fare with. The app will leverage the social trust present in the Hopkins community to make organizing cheap transportation simple.

This is the documentation page for our application. This page is our source of truth, and is actively maintainted throughout the development of the project. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [trysplitit@gmail.com](mailto:trysplitit@gmail.com).
