# How to use GitHub

This tutorial aims to catch you up to speed on using GitHub effectively for our development. Most things you pick up through practice, but if you get stuck, you can always refer to this guide.

## Terminology

- **Git** is a version control system (VCS) that was designed for handling non-linear workflows.
- **GitHub** is a hosting service that uses **Git** to allow users to collaborate, share, and develop software together.
- **Branch** is a term for a development pipeline where you *branch* out of the main version, and allows you to make changes without affecting the original.
- **Merge** is a term for when you take one branch's code and copy it into another, along with some special **Git** magic.
- **Pull Request (PR)** is a term for a request you can make on **GitHub** to automatically **merge** a branch into another.
- **Merge Conflict** is a term for when the automated system cannot account for certain changes, usually when the same line of code is changed in different ways.
