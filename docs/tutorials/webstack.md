# The MERN Stack

Our (website) software is written in the MERN stack, which stands for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

A comprehensive tutorial written by our beloved Professor Ali Madooei can be found [here](https://cs280fa21.github.io/), and it will teach you *everything* you need to know to get started. It's where most of our members learned how to do all this!
